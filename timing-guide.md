# 1. Grammar
## 1.1. Naming convention
1) We only consider an update for a name if the pronunciation/ meaning changes.

2) Recent Oda is king, unless a loud majority hate it/ thinks it makes no sense.(mildly prefering or being "used to" another spelling isn't enough).

3) If there is enough hate, we look to the anime, databooks, Jump and official English versions for alternatives. If we can find none, we come up with our own interpretation.

### 1.1.1. Devil Fruits
Translated to English, while keeping the double noun, like Rubber-Rubber Fruit. The hyphen is always present in the name of the fruit and attack. Furthermore, while Japanese names are translated, exceptions are made for specifically Japanese attacks such as Zoro's Onigiri or Katakuri's Mochi.

### 1.1.7. Abilities
Note: we currently do not translate attack names if they are in a language other than Japanese. E.G. We keep Sanji's and Robin's moves as they are. We also do not translate a move name if a literal translation ruins a reference. E.G. Zoro's "Two-Sword Style Rashomon" attack is a reference to a gate of the same name in Kyoto and a famous movie.

Attack fades are **150 milliseconds** long and should end in an exclamation mark, depending on the vocal exclamation. Example: `{\fad(150,150)}Rubber-Rubber Balloon!`. If there is a pause in the attack, split the line into two, ending the first line in an ellipsis. Both lines should have fading.
