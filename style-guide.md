# 1. Grammar
## 1.1. Naming convention
1) We only consider an update for a name if the pronunciation/ meaning changes.

2) Recent Oda is king, unless a loud majority hate it/ thinks it makes no sense. (mildly preferring or being "used to" another spelling isn't enough).

3) If there is enough hate, we look to the anime, databooks, Jump and official English versions for alternatives. If we can find none, we can come up with our own interpretation of Oda's new spelling.

### 1.1.1. Devil Fruits
Translated to English, while keeping the double noun, like Rubber-Rubber Fruit. The hyphen is always present in the name of the fruit and attack. Furthermore, while Japanese names are translated, exceptions are made for specifically Japanese attacks such as Zoro's Onigiri or Katakuri's Mochi.

- Chop-Chop Fruit
- Flame-Flame Fruit

### 1.1.7. Abilities
Note: we currently do not translate attack names if they are in a language other than Japanese. E.G. We keep Sanji's and Robin's moves as they are. We also do not translate a move name if a literal translation ruins a reference. E.G. Zoro's "Two-Sword Style Rashomon" attack is a reference to a gate of the same name in Kyoto and a famous movie.

## 1.2. Sentence spacing

## 1.4. Ellipses
Lines ending with ellipses (...) must not continue the ellipsis on the following line.

* Correct: `"My name is..."` / `"Luffy!"`
* Incorrect: `"My name is..."` / `"... Luffy!"`

## 1.5. Attacks
### 1.5.1. Fading
*Note: Only relevant to attacks that don't use Karaoke Effects.*

Attack fades are **150 milliseconds** long and should end in an exclamation mark, depending on the vocal exclamation. Example: `{\fad(150,150)}Rubber-Rubber Balloon!`. If there is a pause in the attack, split the line into two, ending the first line in an ellipsis. Both lines should have fading.

## 1.6. Character set
These are the only acceptable characters that can be used in an Aegisub script:
```abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 -.,;:¨'"/!%&()#´`+```

# 2. Standards

The primary language is U.S. English, mixed with occassional loaned words from Japanese depending on the situation.

## 2.2. Numbers
The number format to follow is `10,500,000.00`.

# 3. Styling
## 3.1. Aegisub Styles
- Main: The default style.
- Secondary: When two characters are talking over each other, the less apparent dialog uses this style.
- Flashbacks:  For short flashbacks, when the voice has an echo or similar indicating that it's a flashback.
- Thoughts: For dialog where the character is thinking the line.
- Captions: For infoboxes, signs, etc.
- Note: For TL notes and other notes. Appears on top so it can be used in conjunction with other lines.
- Title: Title card text (HD only).
- Title2: Title card text (SD only).
- Credits: Opening credits.
- Narrator: For when the narrator is speaking.

## 3.2. Credits

- Editor
- QCer
- Translator
- Timer

- Raw provider

# 4. Practices
## 4.1. Lines
- Lines may never be over two rows. Lines that exceed two rows should be rephrased or split into two.
- Each line may only contain one character's dialog. If multiple characters are speaking at the same time, use the Secondary style.

## 4.2. Infoboxes
### 4.2.1. Dialogue
a. For dialogue during infoboxes and captions, if the dialogue line is one line, put it under the infobox with vertical alignment `0`.

b. If the dialogue line is two lines. Place it at the top with `\an8`.

### 4.2.2. Captions
a. Captions are to use the `Caption` style (See above).
  
b. For character infoboxes that are placed bottom centre, put the captions above the infobox, closely matching the line breaks and the font sizes in the Japanese text inside the infobox.

c. For location infoboxes, make sure the caption fits horizontally within the infobox, then place it either above or below the infobox (never to the side). Make sure the font size and line breaks match the Japanese text inside the infobox.
