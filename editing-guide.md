# Editing
## Timeline
With the amount of cuts that we do in our episodes it's easy to get a messy timeline consisting of 10+ tracks making it hard to navigate and maintain your timeline. To avoid this make sure to follow these steps.

First off, video is above, audio is below. Anytime you want to add a video track, do it from the top, and vice versa for the audio. This way we get a simple and intuitive split between the two. Do not change the volume on any audio tracks under any circumstances. If you need to adjust the volume on a clip, do it separately through the volume slider on the relevant clip. Changing the volume on an entire audio track makes it completely useless for any clips other than the one clip you're changing the volume on, and is one big factor to why track bloating happens. You want to keep your tracks neat, close and tidy together so that you have pretty much everything in one place.

Never make a "stair" of audio or video events. This is where you don't use the unused space above/below a audio/video track but rather just keep adding tracks. You want to take every opportunity you get to use the closest unused space from the middle as possible. To avoid track bloating this is very important. :x: [Bad](/images/sGFwMiz.png) :heavy_check_mark: [Good](/images/RBPdESo.png)

Don't keep unedited cuts. This creates unnecessary complexity and easy confusion. If you undid a cut, make sure you put it together again. :x: [Bad](/images/OYIKF48.png) :heavy_check_mark: [Good](/images/krsBpFq.png)

## Still shots
Still shots are done by slowing down a video event to 0% speed and then extending it to the desired length. For the frame you wish to have a still shot of, separate it from the main video event, right-click it, and press "Insert/Remove Envelope" followed by "Velocity" and a green bar will display on the video event. At the beginning of the event right-click at the little green square and press "Set to 0% velocity", now you can drag your event as long as you want to and it will keep still, creating a still shot.
