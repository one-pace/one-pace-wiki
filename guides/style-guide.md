# 1. Grammar
## 1.1. Naming convention
We generally translate everything into English unless it is a character name. (Exceptions are listed below). This means that popular phrases like Nakama will be replaced with something like crewmate, friend or comrade. Foreign words that have been integrated into English, such as Karate or Suishi do not need to be translated. See the list below for a more detailed breakdown of what we use for more disputed translations.

### 1.1.1. Style Guide Rules
The following rules can only be amended by the majority consent of the Team Wiki Council. The council is currently comprised of Halee, Feeso, Sewil, Pepperjack and Galaxy9000, however any team member may join provided they are active in team wiki discussions. The style guide will be what we use for all contemporary releases until we switch to the style notebook terms when working on a definitive release. The main focus of this guide is to try and preserve continuity with our previous releases. The Rules that dictate how the list can be added to or amended are as follows:

1. The style guide must be followed for all One Pace releases until we have closed all the gaps.

2. The terms on the list will be decided strictly on the most used spelling in One Pace. This can be overruled if at least 80% of the council feels the spelling of a term should be updated, due to compelling evidence or preference for a new spelling. 

3. A brand new term, or one never used in One Pace before may be added or amended on the list without issue. If a potentially new Oda romanisation seems to be trying to depict a non fictional “foreign” word, the council can agree to amend it before proceeding. The same policy is applicable for correcting spacing and grammar issues.

### 1.1.2. Devil Fruits
Translated to English, while keeping the double noun, like Rubber-Rubber Fruit. The hyphen is always present in the name of the fruit and attack. Furthermore, while Japanese names are translated, exceptions are made for specifically Japanese attacks such as Zoro's Onigiri or Katakuri's Mochi.

## 1.4. Ellipses
Lines ending with ellipses (...) must not continue the ellipsis on the following line.

* Correct: `"My name is..."` / `"Luffy!"`
* Incorrect: `"My name is..."` / `"... Luffy!"`

## 1.5. Attacks
### 1.5.1. Fading
*Note: Only relevant to attacks that don't use Karaoke Effects.*

Attack fades are **150 milliseconds** long and should end in an exclamation mark, depending on the vocal exclamation. Example: `{\fad(150,150)}Rubber-Rubber Balloon!`. If there is a pause in the attack, split the line into two, ending the first line in an ellipsis. Both lines should have fading.

## 1.6. Character set
These are the only acceptable characters that can be used in an Aegisub script:
```abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 -.,;:¨'"/!%&()#´`+```

# 2. Standards

## 2.3. Others

# 3. Styling
## 3.1. Aegisub Styles
- Main: The default style.
- Secondary: When two characters are talking over each other, the less apparent dialog uses this style.
- Flashbacks:  For short flashbacks, when the voice has an echo or similar indicating that it's a flashback.
- Thoughts: For dialog where the character is thinking the line.
- Captions: For infoboxes, signs, etc.
- Note: For TL notes and other notes. Appears on top so it can be used in conjunction with other lines.
- Title: Title card text (HD only).
- Title2: Title card text (SD only).
- Credits: Opening credits.

# 4. Practices
## 4.1. Lines
1. Lines may never be over two rows. Lines that exceed two rows should be rephrased or split into two.
2. Each line may only contain one character's dialog. If multiple characters are speaking at the same time, use the Secondary style.

## 4.2. Infoboxes
### 4.2.1. Dialogue
1. For dialogue during infoboxes and captions, if the dialogue line is one line, put it under the infobox with vertical alignment `0`.
2. If the dialogue line is two lines. Place it at the top with `\an8`.

### 4.2.2. Captions
1. Captions are to use the `Captions` style (See above).
2. For character infoboxes that are placed bottom centre, put the captions above the infobox, closely matching the line breaks and the font sizes in the Japanese text inside the infobox.
3. For location infoboxes, make sure the caption fits horizontally within the infobox, then place it either above or below the infobox (never to the side). Make sure the font size and line breaks match the Japanese text inside the infobox.

## 4.3 Italics
Some lines sometimes have wrapped italics (Especially thoughts). Make sure to remove these since the Thoughts style itself manages styling such as italics. To remove wrapped italics in Aegisub, select the lines with the wrapped Italics and press Ctrl+H. Tick "Use regular expressions" and "Limit to Selected Rows", and in the "Find what" textbox, input this regex: `(^\{\\i(1|0)?\}|\{\\i(1|0)?\}$)`.
