# 1. Grammar
## 1.1. Naming convention
We generally translate everything into English unless it is a character name. (Exceptions are listed below). This means that popular phrases like Nakama will be replaced with something like crewmate, friend or comrade. Foreign words that have been integrated into English, such as Karate or Suishi do not need to be translated. See the list below for a more detailed breakdown of what we use for more disputed translations.

### 1.1.1. Style Guide Rules
The following rules can only be amended by the majority consent of the Team Wiki Council. The council is currently comprised of Halee, Feeso, Sewil, Pepperjack, Gaijin and Galaxy9000, however any team member may join provided they are active in team wiki discussions. The style guide will be what we use for all contemporary releases until we switch to the style notebook terms when working on a definitive release. The main focus of this guide is to try and preserve continuity with our previous releases. The Rules that dictate how the list can be added to or amended are as follows:

1. The style guide must be followed for all One Pace releases until we have closed all the gaps.

2. The terms on the list will be decided strictly on the most used spelling in One Pace. This can be overruled if at least 80% of the council feels the spelling of a term should be updated, due to compelling evidence or preference for a new spelling. 

3. A brand new term, or one never used in One Pace before may be added or amended on the list without issue. If a potentially new Oda romanisation seems to be trying to depict a non fictional “foreign” word, the council can agree to amend it before proceeding. The same policy is applicable for correcting spacing and grammar issues.

### 1.1.2. Devil Fruits
Translated to English, while keeping the double noun, like Rubber-Rubber Fruit. The hyphen is always present in the name of the fruit and attack. Furthermore, while Japanese names are translated, exceptions are made for specifically Japanese attacks such as Zoro's Onigiri or Katakuri's Mochi.
